# Classic News App

## Description

This is a simple news application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches news articles from a news API and displays them on the page. Users can select different categories to view news on different topics. This is my first project working with APIs, and as a beginner, there might be bugs or areas for improvement. Pull requests and suggestions are very welcome!

## Note on CSS

The CSS for this project is quite basic, as I'm not a big fan of CSS. However, I have extensively used CSS in this project to strengthen my fundamentals and create a good user interface. If you have suggestions for improving the styling, or if you'd like to contribute some CSS improvements, please feel free to do so!
